Emthonjeni Trust gives support to people living with HIV and AIDS in the Eastern Cape in South Africa, particularly to a community where poverty and unemployment prevail and the rate of HIV infection remains alarmingly high.

We support projects run by the [Raphael Centre](http://www.raphaelcentre.co.za), an award winning HIV and AIDS centre in Grahamstown (Makana Municipal District). The Raphael Centre is a NGO which relies almost entirely on charitable organisations for all its funds.

Our vision: An Eastern Cape where people with HIV live healthy lives free from prejudice and discrimination and where HIV infection rates are considerably reduced.

Our mission: To give hope and support to

*   thousands of men and women affected by HIV and AIDS to enable them to fulfil their potential as responsible citizens.
*   hundreds of children by enabling them to recieve a decent education, to thrive and help them achieve a bright future.

Our aims:

*   To raise funds to enable organisations like the Raphael Centre to expand existing HIV and AIDS services to meet the increasing needs of the local community.
*   To raise awareness of HIV and AIDS

An estimated 5.6 million people were living with HIV and AIDS in South Africa in 2009, more than in any other country.  
(UNAIDS 2010)

Who We Are 
----------

Emthonjeni Trust was founded in Cheltenham in 2001 by a group of friends concerned about the devastating impact of AIDS in South Africa, particularly in Grahamstown (Makana Municipal District of the Eastern Cape).

![](/Artifacts/images/SA map002.jpg)

Our committee comprises a small group of volunteers working from our own homes. Administration costs are kept to an absolute minimum.

Over the years we have raised thousands of pounds to help the Raphael Centre to fund salaries, school fees and educational support, testing and counselling services, food parcels, staff training, administration costs, essential equipment, rural outreach services and campaigns to reduce stigma and discrimination.

Our thanks to all our supporters for their belief in our vision, their loyalty and encouragement.

Our only expenses, apart from fundraising, are postage, newsletters, and very occasionally travel. Nobody receives a salary.
